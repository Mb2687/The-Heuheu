<MainLayout title="About The Heuheu" description="Discover the story of The Heuheu, the digital junk drawer for useful browser-based tools.">
    <div class="prose prose-slate max-w-none text-slate-600">
        <p>The Heuheu started with a simple observation: everyone has a "junk drawer" in their home filled with small, useful things that don't belong anywhere else but are essential when you need them.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8">The Digital Junk Drawer</h2>
        <p>We built The Heuheu to be that same drawer for your browser. It is a collection of fast, private, and zero-friction utilities. Whether you are a developer formatting JSON or a creator converting images to WebP, the "Desk Gremlin" has collected the right tool for the job.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8">Why "The Heuheu"?</h2>
        <p>In our canon, the Heuheu is the helpful gremlin that keeps your digital workspace tidy. We believe tools should be accessible without accounts, subscriptions, or tracking. Everything we build runs in your browser, keeping your data private and your workflow fast.</p>
