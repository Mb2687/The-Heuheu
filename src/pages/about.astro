    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">About The Heuheu</h1>
    <div class="prose prose-slate max-w-none text-slate-600">
        <p>The Heuheu is a collection of high-utility online tools designed with a "zero friction" philosophy. Inspired by the useful things found in a physical desk junk drawer, this digital drawer collects the utilities you need every day: from image converters to developer tools.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8">Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>We believe that online tools should be fast, private, and free. That is why we built The Heuheu to run entirely in your browser. We do not require accounts, we do not ask for your email, and we never see your files.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8">The Desk Gremlin</h2>
        <p>Who is The Heuheu? Think of it as a helpful desk gremlin that scurries around finding the best ways to solve small digital problems. Whether you need to compress a photo for SEO or convert a measurement, the gremlin has a tool ready for you.</p>
